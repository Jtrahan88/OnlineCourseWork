Goal: Create a program that takes text and determones its eading level.

We will use the Coleman-Liau index algorithm: index(grade) = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S -15.8
L = is the average number of letters per 100 words
S = is teh avager number of sentenses per 100 words in the  text


Example:
"Text: Congratulations! Today is your day. You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!"
ANSWER: Grade 3

The text the user inputted has 65 letters, 4 sentences, and 14 words. 65 letters per 14 words is an average of about 464.29 letters per 100 words
(because 65 / 14 * 100 = 464.29).
 L = ---letters / words * 100-----
And 4 sentences per 14 words is an average of about 28.57 sentences per 100 words
(because 4 / 14 * 100 = 28.57).
 S = ---Sentences / words * 100-----
 Plugged into the Coleman-Liau formula, and rounded to the nearest integer,we get an answer of 3
index(grade) = (because 0.0588 * 464.29 - 0.296 * 28.57 - 15.8 = 3)
: so this passage is at a third-grade reading level.


STEPS:
1) PRompt user for a string - DONE!
2) Count the number of letters in the string
- skip all spaces and non char letes not between a-z or A-Z - DONE!
3) Count words
- if there is a space that indicates one word. - DONE!
4) Count Sentances
- any period(.), exclamation point(1), or questions mark(?) indicates teh end of a sentance- DONE!
5) Print out "Grade x" where x = grade level calculated
-*** Two additonal Condition to follow:
 ----if grade is 16 or higher program should print out "Grade 16+"
 ----if grade is less than 1 program should print out "Before Grade 1"- DONE!
