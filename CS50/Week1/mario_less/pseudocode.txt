1st) prompt user for input height from 1-8 inclusive
-if input is not 1-8 reprompt user again do while loop

2nd) make a # pyramid for the amount of of the height

3rd) iterate from 1 to height:
   - on iteration i, print i hashes and then new line
   - using another loop for the columns
4th) reverse the pyramid by at first putting dots to push teh bricks over to the right
-- will depend on height of pyramid and row number
-- dots = height - row_num -1

5th) replace the dots with spaces
