Basiclly play around with teh scratch programs to make yourself a fun program. This is teaching us the fundamentals on how loops, conditionals, variables, etc
work in a clear cut way.

In my opinion this should be part of school teaching mandatory for all. Reason being even if the student does not want to code that is ok, but this will
help with learning a computer, problem solving and most of all creativity.

This bring fund to coding.
